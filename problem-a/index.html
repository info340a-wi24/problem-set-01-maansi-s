    <p>
        From the movie <cite><a href="https://princess.disney.com/rapunzel">"Tangled"</a></cite>, Rapunzel is a Disney princess whose story is about her being
        kidnapped from her family of royalty by the greedy Mother Gothel. With her
        magical, long hair that has healing powers, Mother Gothel uses Rapunzel
        to maintain her youth and "beauty." Since Rapunzel was kidnapped as an infant,
        she lives her life in naivety and control, but grows up to find the love of
        her life, reconnect with her family, and leave the curse of Mother Gothel.

        I admire Rapunzel because she...
        <ul>
            <li class="art-list">is great at painting and drawing</li>
            <li>loves baking and cooking</li>
            <li>is an animal-lover</li>
        </ul>
